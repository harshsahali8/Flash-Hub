## About The Project

![Screen Shot](./public/images/flashhub-screenshot.png)  
*(Add a screenshot of your app here during the hackathon!)*

FlashHub, crafted by Team Flash for StackFusionFest, is an AI-powered decentralized voting platform. Submit ideas—proposals, projects, or solutions—vote with a tap, and see real-time results. AI crunches trends to spotlight winners, while a Blockchain-ready design ensures trust. It’s fast, sleek, and built to make decisions matter!

**Problem:**  
- Voting’s slow, opaque, and lacks real-time punch.  
- People need a clear, trusted way to decide—fast.

**Solution:**  
- FlashHub: Drop ideas, vote instantly, and watch live results—supercharged by AI and mock Blockchain transparency.
